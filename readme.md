### Basic outline of how the grammar works
The origin gives the basic sentence structure of the Tweet

```
	"origin": ["#enhance# your #meetings# by #engaging with# #whiteboarding#"]

```

Everything in the origin enclosed by "#" is treated as a variable. These are modified by adding to or removing from the associated array e.g.

```
	"enhance" : ["Enhance", "Optimize", "Drive", "Rethink", "Hack", "Intensify", "Boost", "Innovate", "Streamline", "Simplify", "Extend", "Reinvent", "Augment", "Strengthen", "Upgrade", "Invigorate", "Advance", "Raise the profile of", "Progress", "Elevate", "Over-complicate", "Revise", "Rework", "Revolutionize", "Bring new life to", "Create engagement with", "Polish"]

```
